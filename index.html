      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
      I am a passionate computer science student with a keen interest in web and mobile development, as well as data analysis. My journey in tech began with a curiosity for how things work behind the scenes, which led me to explore various programming languages and tools. As I delved deeper, my fascination with data analytics grew, driving me to learn more about extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets. Beyond academics, I am also a football enthusiast, finding joy in both playing the sport and following my favorite team FC Barcelona. My goal is to combine my technical skills and love for tech to contribute to innovative projects in the tech industry.
